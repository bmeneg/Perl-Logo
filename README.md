# Perl's Camel Usage

## Introduction

The Perl Language never had a definitive and official logo/mascot to represent it across different published material,
until Tim O'Reilly published in 1991 the first book about Perl, Programming Perl, which was presented with a *camel*
on its cover, which became widely known and used, unofficially, as the Perl's mascot since then. However, due to
O'Reilly, not so clear, restrictive rules on using the camel, different attempts of creating new logos was made during
the years, being that two are most prominent:

1. The onion, held by The Perl Foundation;
2. The velociraptor.

Nevertheless, neither ideas experimented the same strength as the camel from [Programming Perl](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-perl-4th/9781449321451/) book (the "Camel book"); the camel still
is, by far, the most used and known mascot on Perl ecosystem. With that, this guideline is about the current state of
camel's usage permission and restriction, following Tim O'Reilly advice and words after different emails exchanged
with him to better understand them.

Another caveat to note is the complexity of the original camel image, which was used in a book cover with enough canva
to draw a really detailed camel, really different from what is seen in the current days with small mobile screens,
where small versions of the original camel would be needed and the details would get lost and, consequently, deforming
the original image, i.e. website favicons or menu/button icons. Hence a simplified version of the camel was adopted,
the [_shadowed camel_](https://icon-icons.com/icon/file-type-perl/130272), which follows the original camel silhouette
and substitutes its internal details completely by a single solid color.

## Shadowed Camel License

This camel is the same used by Visual Studio Code as file type icon for Perl file extensions (`.pl` and `.pm`).

## Usage guideline

Following are the permissions and allowances that we, the Perl community, must follow when using the **original** and
the **shadowed** camels:

We, the Perl community, are **not allowed** to use the **original** camel image for:

1. Publishing new books or materials using the camel with a different publisher other than O'Reilly;
2. Self-publish new books or materials using the camel.

We, the Perl community, are **allowed** to use the **shadowed** camel image for:

1. Referencing the Perl Language (as its official mascot);
2. Sharing free and open source material in the internet;
3. Conferences, workshops, meetings, or any in person reunion to reference Perl on advertising materials.

Other camels or logos used to reference the Perl Language are not under the restrictions of this guideline.
From the date of writhing this guideline onwards, the Perl community accepts the **shadowed camel** as its official
mascot.
